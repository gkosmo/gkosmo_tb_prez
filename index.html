        <p>George Kosmopoulos AKA gkosmo </p>
        <h1>A presentation </h1>
      </div>
      
      <span> Born on the 3rd of april 1986 in Brussels, Belgium </span>
      <span> From a greek father and a belgian mother </span>
      <br>
      <span> George is destined to live a life as a human on earth </span>
      <br>
      <span> He learned a bit of greek through holidays in Greece </span>
      <span> and did  6 years of dutch classes at school </span>
      <br>
      <span> yet he was never good at languages. </span>
      <br>
      <span> What George loves is reading. He has been an avid reader </span>
      <span> for as long as he remembers </span>
      <br>
      <span> It is also a well known that George doesn't have the best memory about his life </span>
      <br>
      <span> George discovers scifi in his late teenagers years </span>
      <span> starting with the classics (Asimov, Frank Herbert) </span>
      <span> he later moves on to loving humanist scifi writers like </span>
      <br>
      <span> Ursula K. Leguin, Kim Stanley Robinson and Iain M Banks </span>
      <br>
      <span> Until today, George isn't aware that he also needs 3 parts names to love a writer </span>
      <br>
      <span> George went to Thailand in 2006 to do 6 months volunteering work </span>
      <br>
      <span> And there he met his German partner </span>
      <span>, now wife,with whom they built a solid home </span>
      <br>
      <span> ( where we have lots of space for anyone visiting brussels btw ;) ) </span>
      <br>
      <span> and have the most beautiful daughter: Iris </span>
